## üì± How It Works

### For Customers (Paying)

2. **Enter Amount** - The merchant account is pre-filled, just enter the payment amount in USD
3. **Confirm Payment** - Click "Pay with Keychain" to complete the transaction via Hive Keychain or HiveSigner

### For Merchants (Receiving)
1. **Generate QR Code** - Go to the QR Generator page and enter your Hive account name
2. **Print & Display** - Use the "Print QR" button to create stickers, signs, or business cards
3. **Accept Payments** - Customers scan your QR and pay instantly in HBD (1 USD = 1 HBD)

## üîß Technical Details

### Payment Flow
1. Customer scans QR: `menobass.github.io/okpay?vendor=merchantname`
2. Payment page loads with merchant account pre-filled
3. Customer enters amount (treated as USD but paid in HBD)
4. Unique memo generated for transaction tracking
5. Payment submitted via Keychain API or deep link fallback

### Memo Format
Memos follow the pattern: `kcs-hpos-1234-5678` (8 random digits)

### Supported Wallets
- **Hive Keychain** (Browser extension - preferred)
- **HiveSigner** (Web-based fallback)
